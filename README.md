<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This is a weather application built with SvelteKit. You can see the demo [here](https://weather-app-dev-io.vercel.app/).

Building this project helped me improve my skills in working with APIs greatly and handling asynchronous operations in Svelte. I also learned how to use SvelteKit's method of sharing data to the page and how ssr and csr work as a whole.

Overall, even though I am still learning, I am deeply proud of myself of being able to complete this project and learn many new technologies while doing so.

### Built With

This application allows you to:

- View weather information for a specific area, city, state, or country
